# Physical-Activity-Tracker-App

&ensp;&ensp;Our software provides sensor data from a physical device that tracks a userâ€™s physical activity. Raw sensor data does not have much value to an unsophisticated user, our application is designed to interpret that data visually in a way that is not only more appealing but also more informative.
